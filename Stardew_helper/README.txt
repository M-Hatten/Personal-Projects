The plan for this program is to make a better helper for use when playing stardew valley

Uses:
Fish - will display season, time to catch, and weather
Produce - will display if it's best to put them in kegs or preserving jars
Mods - track which mods are currently being used and link to their nexus mods page

For Fish and Produce, if the entry is not found, will prompt the user to add the information for it
