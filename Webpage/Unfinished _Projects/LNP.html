    <h1>Welcome to the Late NIght Pizza webpage!</h1>

    <p>Here I'll be showcasing the current progress I've made on an up and coming video game: Late Night Pizza. I'm in a team with several artists, though I am the only programmer for the entire project. That means I'm handling everything not related to the graphics! It's a tall order, I know! I joined the project as its programmer in <strong>July 2024</strong>. In joining the project, not only have I had to learn a whole new programming language to work with Godot Utility Engine, but I had to learn how to program video games in general. This is the first video game I've ever programmed for, so each step in development is a learning milestone for me.</p>
    <p> As of <strong>December 2024</strong>, here's all the progress I've made:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Rigged player body and controls to move in a three-dimensional plane</li>
        <li>Uploaded scenery models and applied collisions to the scene to give the player character areas to traverse</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Here are screenshots showcasing the progress I've made thus far and explanations for what you're seeing!</p>
