            <p>Here I'll be showcasing the current progress I've made on an up and coming video game: Late Night Pizza. I'm in a team with several artists, though I am the only programmer for the entire project. That means I'm handling everything not related to the graphics! It's a tall order, I know! I joined the project as its programmer in <strong>July 2024</strong>. In joining the project, not only have I had to learn a whole new programming language to work with Godot Utility Engine, but I had to learn how to program video games in general. This is the first video game I've ever programmed for, so each step in development is a learning milestone for me.</p>
