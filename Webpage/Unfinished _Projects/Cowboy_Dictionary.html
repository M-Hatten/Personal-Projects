            <p>This here is one of my more interesting project ideas. I woke up and decided I needed a way to translate today's modern lingo into cowboy lingo from the days of the Wild West. This program has many functions. First and formost, it is a full database of every cowboy slang term and its exact definition. The user is able to search via slang term or definition. Furthermore, the user can search using general keywords that will list each term that applies along with its definition.</p>
