/*
Hello! 
This code is to help me keep track of how much time I've put into crocheting comissions!

This app should be relatively simple.
Functions:
- Track multiple projects at once
- Allow user to "clock in" and "clock out"
- Allow user to enter material costs
- Allow user to set labor cost (Ex. $5 per hour of labor)
- clocking in starts a timer
- clocking out stops the timer and logs the time taken
- Saves all data to a txt or json file so it is able to keep track of data when program is not running
- when a project is complete, computes how much the project will sell for using material and labor cost
